        <h1>Bob Dylan</h1>
        <h4>Gotta serve somebody</h4>
        <p>You May Be An ambassador to England or France,<br> You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,<br> You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,<br> You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls</p>
        <p>But you're gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed<br> You're gonna have to serve somebody,<br> Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord<br> But you're gonna have to serve somebody.</p>
        <p>You might be a rock 'n' roll addict prancing on the stage,<br> You might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,<br> You may be a business man or some high degree thief,<br> They may call you Doctor or they may call you Chief</p>
        <p>But you're gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed<br> You're gonna have to serve somebody,<br> Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord<br> But you're gonna have to serve somebody.</p>
        <p>You may be a state trooper, you might be a young Turk,<br> You may be the head of some big TV network,<br> You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,<br> You may be living in another country under another name</p>
        <p>But you're gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed<br> You're gonna have to serve somebody,<br> Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord<br> But you're gonna have to serve somebody.</p>
        <p>You may be a construction worker working on a home,<br> You may be living in a mansion or you might live in a dome,<br> You might own guns and you might even own tanks,<br> You might be somebody's landlord, you might even own banks</p>
        <p>But you're gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed<br> You're gonna have to serve somebody,<br> Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord<br> But you're gonna have to serve somebody.</p>
        <p>You may be a preacher with your spiritual pride,<br> You may be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,<br> You may be workin' in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,<br> You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir</p>
        <p>But you're gonna ...</p>
        <p>Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,<br> Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,<br> You might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,<br> You may be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-sized bed</p>
        <p>But you're gonna ...</p>
        <p>You may call me Terry, you may call me Timmy,<br> You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy,<br> You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,<br> You may call me anything but no matter what you say</p>
        <p>But you're gonna ...</p>
